# playerctl-lyrics
Uses `playerctl metadata` output to get song data and makes a GET request to https://lrclib.net/ to get synced lyrics. These synced lyrics are then printed to stdout in sync with `playerctl position`.

This small thingie is primarily designed for bars like [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar).

*there will be a GIF when I actually get it to work*

*other stuff coming as well like building, using, configuration, etc.*
